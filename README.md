Capstone project: Providing data-driven suggestions for HR
The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it.They have the following question: what’s likely to make the employee leave the company?

Your goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

If you can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.

Step 1. Imports
Import packages
Load dataset

Step 2. Data Exploration (Initial EDA and data cleaning)
Understand your variables
Clean your dataset (missing data, redundant data, outliers)

Step 2. Data Exploration (Continue EDA)
Data visualizations: examine variables that you're interested in, and create plots to visualize relationships between variables in the data.

Step 3. Model Building, use the best random forest model and the best XGBoost model to predict on the validation data. Whichever performs better will be selected as the champion model. 
Fit a model that predicts the outcome variable using two or more independent variables
Check model assumptions

Step 4. Results and Evaluation
Evaluate the model
